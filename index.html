            <p>I have used HTML, CSS along with JavaScript to code an iPod player that you see to the left. The project consisted of three HTML pages simulating the ‘Songs’, ‘Albums’, and ‘Player’ pages of the iPod player. Click on the picture to the left to see the magic unravels!

              <p> Covid-19 certainly created logistical challenges for many hospitals in terms of staffing scheduling and equipment availability. This specific project was concerned with optimizing the utility and scheduling of part-time and full-time nurse personnel at a certain hospital. Deterministic modeling was used to conclude the effective combination of part-time and full-time nurses that would ensure all shifts to be covered while providing the lowest cost to the hospital. The AMPL software was used to quantify and stratify the nurses according to shift worked and work status (part-time or full-time) to acheive our minimization objective. And, the obtained optimal staffing solution was to employ only full-time nurses.
